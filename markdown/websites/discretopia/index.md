[Discretopia](https://discretopia.com) is an educational website that covers 100+ discrete math topics in a uniquely thoughtful way.

All its content is written in everyday language, so each page reads like a conversation!

I've received positive responses on the website's approachable style of writing and overall design. I believe that a concise, beautiful design can complement the learning experience.
