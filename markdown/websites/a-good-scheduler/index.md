[A Good Scheduler](https://agoodscheduler.com) is unlike any other scheduling web app you've used before.

Instead of having the user block out a schedule, it simply asks for their requirements and computes every combination, eliminating the trial-and-error of having to build schedules manually.

Those who have used this website for their scheduling needs describe it as something they never knew they always wanted.
